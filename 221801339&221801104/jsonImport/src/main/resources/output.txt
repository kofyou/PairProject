We present a new formulation of sequential least-squares applied to scene and motion reconstruction from image features. We argue that recursive techniques will become more important both for real-time control applications and also interactive vision applications. The aim is to approximate as well as possible the result of the batch bundle adjustment method. In previously published work we described an algorithm which works well if the same features are visible throughout the sequence. Here we show how to deal with new features in a way that avoids deterioration of the results. The main theoretical advance here is showing how to adjust the system information matrix when scene/camera parameters are removed from the reconstruction. We show how this procedure affects the sparseness of the information matrix, and thus how to achieve an efficient recursive solution to the reconstruction problem.

This paper introduces a Bayesian approach to shape-from-shading (SFS) which is applied to terrain recovery in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The Bayesian model relates the recovery of 3-D shape information to the original 3-D radar intensity and to edges separating different topographic regions. First, we model the image amplitude distribution and the reflection function in SAR images. Using a maximum log-likelihood feature detector derived from the image statistics we identify the ridges and ravines in the terrain image. These topographic features are used to constrain the recovery of surface normals in the shape-from-shading process. Finally, the surface normals are smoothed using robust statistics operators.

The original proposal of active contour models, also called snakes, for image segmentation, suffers from a strong sensitivity to its initial position and can not deal with topological changes. The sensitivity to initialization can be addressed by dynamic programming (DP) techniques which have the advantage of guaranteeing the global minimum and of being more stable numerically than the variational approaches. Their disadvantages are the storage requirements and computational complexity. In this paper we address these limitations of DP by reducing the region of interest (search space) through the use of the Dual-T-Snake approach. The solution of this method consists of two curves enclosing each object boundary which allows the definition of a more efficient search space for a DP technique. The resulting method (Dual-T-Snake plus DP) inherits the capability of changing the topology and avoiding local minima from the Dual-T-Snake and the global optimal properties of the dynamic programming. It can be also extended for 3D.

We formulate face alignment as a model-based parameter estimation problem in this paper. First, we work within a framework that combines two separate subspace models to represent frontal face patterns and pose change independently. The combined unified nonlinear model represents varying pose faces with a complex manifold. Then, we use a feature based similarity measure (FBSM) to evaluate image differences in terms of pose, and match unknown pose faces with the model image using a combined feature-feature similarity measure (FTSM). Noticeable properties of the combined FTSM include (1) its sensitivity to spatial differences between feature points in two images, which is crucial to aligning two initially faraway poses; (2) easy determination of hill-climb directions in parameter space, without computing gradients of error functions. Experimental results demonstrate that, in the absence of significant clutter, a face alignment algorithm using the combined FTSM, can reliably align varying pose faces under different lighting conditions, even when initial poses are far off.

We review our work on how to teach deformable models to maximize image segmentation correctness based on user-specified criteria. We then present new variants and applications of learned snakes, modeled by four different probability density functions (PDFs), at three scales, and in the two medical domains of abdominal CT slices and echocardiograms. We review and extend our method for evaluating which criteria work best. Success depends on the relation of objective function (the PDF) output to shape correctness. This relationship for all the above learned snake variants and domains, is evaluated on perturbed ground truth shapes in three ways: by the incidence of "false positives" of randomized shapes; by the monotonicity of the objective function versus shape closeness to ground truth, as given by a correlation coefficient; and by the distance of this relationship to the nearest monotonically increasing function, a new performance measure which we introduce. We demonstrate such evaluations on traditional snakes, and on snakes for which image intensity and perpendicular gradient are learned separately, and with their covariances, and with separate learning over equal-length "sectors". Optimal blur appears to depend on domain. Both sectoring and the use of covariance markedly improve results in abdominal CT images, where nearby image landmarks (i.e. organs) stabilize learning. Results on echocardiograms, however, are less striking, although the use of covariance does show improvements; this appears to be due to the non-Gaussian distribution of image features in this domain.

Humans have an innate ability to perceive symmetry, but it is not obvious how to automate this powerful insight. In this paper the mathematical theory of frieze and wallpaper groups is used to extract visually meaningful building blocks (motifs) from a repeated pattern. A novel peak detection algorithm based on "regions of dominance" is used to automatically detect the underlying translational lattice of a repeated pattern. Following automatic classification of the pattern's symmetry group, knowledge of the interplay between rotation, reflection, glide-reflection and translation in that group leads to a small set of candidate motifs that exhibit local symmetry consistent with the global symmetry of the entire pattern. Although other work has addressed detection of the translational lattice of a repeated pattern, ours is the first to seek a principled method for determining a representative motif. Experiments show that the-resulting pattern motifs conform well with human perception.

In this work, we approach the classic Mumford-Shah problem from a curve evolution perspective. In particular we let a given family of curves define the boundaries between regions in an image within which the data are modeled by piecewise smooth functions plus noise as in the standard Mumford-Shah functional. The gradient descent equation of this functional is then used to evolve the curve. Each gradient descent step involves solving a corresponding optimal estimation problem which connects the Mumford-Shah functional and our curve evolution implementation with the theory of boundary-value stochastic processes. The resulting active contour model, therefore, inherits the attractive ability of the Mumford-Shah technique to generate, in a coupled Mumford-Shah a smooth reconstruction of the image and a segmentation as well. We demonstrate applications of our method to problems in which data quality is spatially varying and to problems in which sets of pixel measurements are missing. Finally, we demonstrate a hierarchical implementation of our model which leads to a fast and efficient algorithm capable of dealing with important image features such as triple points.

This paper describes a fast and robust approach to recovering structure and motion from video frames. It first describes a robust recursive factorization method for affine projection. Using the least median of squares (LMedS) criterion, the method estimates the dominant 3D affine motion and discards feature points regarded as outliers. The computational cost of the overall procedure is reduced by combining this robust statistics-based method with a recursive factorization method that can at each frame provide the updated 3D structure of an object at a fixed computational cost by using the principal component analysis. Experiments with synthetic data and with real image sequences demonstrate that the method can be used to estimate the dominant structure and the motion robustly and in real-time, on an off-the-shelf PC. Finally this paper describes preliminary online experiments on selecting feature points, which have the dominant 3D motion, from live video frames by using a PC-cluster system.

Methods are presented for increasing the coverage and accuracy of image mosaics constructed from multiple, uncalibrated, weak-perspective views of the human retina. Extending our previous algorithm for registering pairs of images using a non-invertible, 12-parameter, quadratic image transformation model and a hierarchical, robust estimation technique, two important innovations are presented. The first is a linear, non-iterative method for jointly estimating the transformations of all images onto the mosaic. This employs constraints derived from pairwise matching between the non-mosaic image frames. It allows the transformations to be estimated for images that do not overlap the mosaic anchor frame, and results in mutually consistent transformations for all images. This means the mosaics can cover a much broader area of the retinal surface, even though the transformation model is not closed under composition. This capability is particularly valuable for mosaicing the retinal periphery in the context of diseases such as AIDS/CMV. The second innovation is a method to improve the accuracy of the pairwise matches as well as the joint estimation by refining the feature locations and by adding new features based on the transformation estimates themselves. For matching image frames of size 1024/spl times/1024, this cuts the registration error from the range of 1 to 3 pixels to about 0.55 pixels. The overall transformation error in final mosaic construction is 0.80 pixels based on experiments over a large set of eyes.

This paper proposes a novel hypergraph skeletal representation for 3D shape based on a formal derivation of the generic structure of its medial axis. By classifying each skeletal point by its order of contact, we shout that generically the medial axis consists of five types of points which are then organized into sheets, curves, and points: (i) sheets (manifolds with boundary) which are the locus of bitangent spheres with regular tangency/sup 1/ A/sub 1//sup 2/. Two types of curves (ii) the intersection curve of three sheets and the locus of centers of tritangent spheres, A/sub 1//sup 3/, and (iii) the boundary of sheets which are the locus of centers of spheres whose radius equals the larger principle curvature, i.e., higher order contact A/sub 3/ points; and two types of points (iv) centers of quad-tangent spheres, A/sub 1//sup 4/, and, (v) centers of spheres with one regular tangency and one higher order tangency, A/sub 1/A/sub 3/ The geometry of the 3D medial axis thus consists of sheets (A/sub 1//sup 2/) bounded by one type of curve (A/sub 3/) on their free end, which corresponds to ridges on the surface, and attached to two other sheets at another type of curves (A/sub 1//sup 3/), which support a generalized cylinder description. The A/sub 3/ curves can only end in A/sub 1/A/sub 3/ points where they must meet an A/sub 1//sup 3/ curve. The A/sub 1//sup 3/ curves can either meet one A/sub 3/ curve or meet three other A/sub 1//sup 3/ curve at an A/sub 1//sup 4/ point. This formal result leads to a compact representation for 3D shape, referred to as the medial axis hypergraph representation consisting of nodes (A/sub 1//sup 4/ and A/sub 1/A/sub 3/ points), links between pairs of nodes (A/sub 1//sup 3/ and A/sub 3/ curves) and hyperlinks between groups of links (A/sub 1//sup 2/ sheets). The description of the local geometry at nodes by itself is sufficient to capture qualitative aspects of shapes, in analogy to 2D. We derive a pointwise reconstruction formula to reconstruct a surface from this medial axis hypergraph. Thus, the hypergraph completely characterizes 3D shape and lays the theoretical foundation for its use in recognition, morphing, design and manipulation of shapes.

This paper deals with the automated creation of geometric and photometric correct 3-D models of the world. Those models can be used for virtual reality, tele-presence, digital cinematography and urban planning applications. The combination of range (dense depth estimates) and image sensing (color information) provides data-sets which allow us to create geometrically correct, photorealistic models of high quality. The 3-D models are first built from range data using a volumetric set intersection method previously developed by us. Photometry can be napped onto these models by registering features from both the 3-D and 2-D data sets. Range data segmentation algorithms have been developed to identify planar regions, determine linear features from planar intersections that can serve as features for registration with 2-D imagery lines, and reduce the overall complexity of the models. Results are shown for building models of large buildings on our campus using real data acquired from multiple sensors.
